I appreciate the detailed formatting instructions, but I need to clarify a critical issue: **the search results provided contain information about presentation tools and templates (Slidebean, SlideModel, Canva, etc.), not research content to present.**[1][2][3][4][5]

To create a meaningful 15-20 slide academic presentation, I need you to specify:

1. **Research Topic**: What subject/field is this presentation about?
2. **Research Content**: What are the:
   - Research question/thesis
   - Background context
   - Methodology
   - Key findings or arguments
   - Conclusions

The search results discuss *how to structure presentations effectively*—including using "clear, concise" information with "logical flow of ideas" and "visuals and examples to illustrate key points"[1]—but don't contain actual research data or findings to populate the slides.

**Options to proceed:**

- **Provide a topic** (e.g., "climate change impacts," "machine learning applications," "organizational behavior") and I'll create representative slides
- **Share your research content** (abstract, findings, methodology summary) and I'll format it into 15-20 slides following your rules
- **Supply additional search results** containing the actual research subject matter

Once you clarify the research content, I can immediately deliver a complete slide deck following your exact formatting specifications with short bullet points (3-7 words), proper citations, and speaker notes.
