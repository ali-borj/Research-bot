# Presentation: HDDM & FAce par

I appreciate the detailed formatting specifications, but I need to clarify an important issue: **the search results provided are about presentation creation tools and templates, not about research content for an academic presentation**.

The search results discuss platforms like Slidebean, SlideModel, Figma, PowerPoint, and Canva—which are tools for *building* presentations—rather than substantive research material that would populate the slides.[1][2][3][4][5]

To create a 15-20 slide academic presentation following your specifications, I would need search results containing:

- **The actual research topic and findings** (e.g., methodology, data, conclusions)
- **Key statistics and results** to populate the "Key Findings" slides
- **Background literature** for context and references
- **Specific hypotheses and research questions** for that domain

**What I can do:**

1. **If you provide search results about a specific research topic**, I can create the complete 15-20 slide deck with your exact formatting (short bullets, speaker notes, mermaid diagrams, proper slide structure)

2. **I can create a template/example presentation** on a sample research topic using your specifications to demonstrate the format

Which would be most helpful? Please either:
- Share search results about your specific research topic, or
- Let me know what topic you'd like the example presentation to cover
