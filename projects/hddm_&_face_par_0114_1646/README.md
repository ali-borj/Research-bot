I don't have access to the research project details needed to generate this repository. Your query references "the project described in the report," "Step 2," "Step 3," and specific hypotheses (H1–H5) with a 2×2×3 task design, but these details aren't included in the current conversation or the search results provided.

To create the complete repository files you've requested, I would need:

- **The original research report or project description** containing the research questions, experimental design, and theoretical background
- **Details of the 2×2×3 task structure** (the three factors and their levels)
- **Explicit hypotheses H1–H5** linking instruction/base-rate/evidence level and extraversion to DDM parameters (v, a, z, t)
- **Preliminary results or analysis plans** from Step 2 and Step 3 that you mention
- **Dataset schema specifics** (e.g., which stimulus conditions map to which columns)

The search results provided [1-10] offer general best practices for research repository structure (folder organization, README conventions, reproducibility standards), but they don't contain your project's specific content.

**Next steps:** Please share the research report, task design documentation, and hypotheses, and I can generate the complete GitHub repository with:
- Properly populated README.md tied to your hypotheses
- Analysis plan matching your DDM model specifications
- Scaffold Python code for HDDM fitting
- Data schema documentation aligned with your stimulus types and factors
