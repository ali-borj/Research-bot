I cannot complete this task as requested because the input materials are incomplete:

**Missing Components:**

1. **Incomplete Report Content**: The report excerpt ends mid-sentence ("whereas falsely Diagrams (Mermaid)...") and lacks:
   - Complete Introduction and Methods sections
   - Results and Discussion sections
   - Full Reference list (essential per your constraint: "Do not invent citations")
   - Visualizations/Mermaid diagram code referenced in the prompt

2. **No Reference List**: You specified "Any reference must appear in the report reference list"—but no reference list was provided. Without it, I cannot populate the "References:" footers you require for each slide's APA 7 citations.

3. **Incomplete Specifications**: The study design details (e.g., full hypotheses, statistical thresholds, participant demographics) are partially described but would need verification in the complete Methods section.

**What I Need to Proceed:**

- Complete, untruncated report text (all sections)
- Full reference list in APA 7 format
- Mermaid diagram code (if available) from the Visualizations section
- Confirmation of key details (e.g., sample size N=30–40, analysis software, expected effect sizes)

**Alternative Approach:**

If you'd like, I can create **template files** that demonstrate the structure (README.md and SLIDES.md scaffolding) using only the abstract and partial introduction provided, with clear **[PLACEHOLDER]** markers for missing sections. You would then populate these templates with the complete report content and references.

Which approach would be more helpful?
