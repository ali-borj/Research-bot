# Validated DDM Decomposition of Face Pareidolia Decisions Under Speed/Accuracy × Base-Rate Manipulations

## A Preregistered Study

# Slide 1: Title & Authors

# Validated DDM Decomposition of Face Pareidolia

- **Principal Investigator:** [Author Name]
- **Affiliation:** [Department, Institution]
- **Research Framework:** Preregistered empirical study
- **Methodology:** Hierarchical Bayesian drift diffusion

*This presentation outlines a preregistered computational study examining how people perceive faces in ambiguous visual stimuli using advanced cognitive modeling techniques.*

---

# Slide 2: Core Research Question

## Why Do We See Faces Where None Exist?

- How do **latent cognitive mechanisms** drive pareidolia decisions?
- Can **drift diffusion model** decompose face perception processes?

*Our central question: What cognitive processes—evidence accumulation, decision thresholds, response bias—explain face detection in ambiguous stimuli?*

---

# Slide 3: Why This Matters

- **Theoretical:** Validates computational models of ambiguous perception
- **Applied:** Reveals personality-decision policy relationships
- **Neuroscience:** Bridges cognitive & personality psychology

*Understanding pareidolia illuminates fundamental principles of how the brain integrates sensory evidence with expectations, with implications for perception, decision-making, and personality psychology.*

---

# Slide 4: Background – Face Perception

- Face detection shows **adaptive bias** toward sensitivity
- Misses face → **high evolutionary cost**
- False detection → **minimal cost**
- Reflects **dynamic interplay** of evidence, expectations, policy

*From an evolutionary perspective, our visual system is calibrated to err on the side of detecting faces, even at the cost of false positives—a phenomenon revealing core principles of perceptual organization.*

---

# Slide 5: Background – Drift Diffusion Model

- **DDM decomposes** behavioral decisions into mechanisms
- Measures: drift rate (*v*), boundary separation (*a*)
- Captures: response bias (*z*), non-decision time (*t₀*)
- **Hierarchical Bayesian HDDM** enhances parameter recovery

*The drift diffusion model is a formally validated framework across 100+ cognitive domains. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach leverages shared statistical structure across participants for enhanced estimation.*

---

# Slide 6: Research Gap

- **Limited DDM studies** of face pareidolia
- **No mechanistic decomposition** under base-rate manipulation
- **Personality effects** on perceptual thresholds unexplored
- Gap between models & ambiguous face perception

*While DDM has revolutionized understanding of perceptual decision-making, face pareidolia—combining ambiguity, personality differences, and contextual task effects—remains unexplored with this framework.*

---

# Slide 7: Hypotheses

1. Speed instructions **reduce boundary separation** (*a*)
2. Accuracy instructions **increase boundary separation** (*a*)
3. High base-rate **biases starting point** (*z*) toward "face"
4. Base-rate effects **modulate drift rate** (*v*) for ambiguous stimuli
5. Extraversion **correlates** with lower *a*, higher face-bias

*These hypotheses operationalize mechanistic predictions: task demands affect decision thresholds, prior information biases both starting point and evidence accumulation, and personality predicts individual differences in decision policy.*

---

# Slide 8: Methodology – Design

- **2 × 2 within-subjects design**
- Factor 1: Speed vs. Accuracy instruction
- Factor 2: High vs. Low face base-rate
- 4 randomized blocks per participant

*A within-subjects factorial design efficiently tests how task instructions and prior probability information independently and interactively modulate decision mechanisms.*

---

# Slide 9: Methodology – Participants & Stimuli

- **N = 30–40** participants
- **Three evidence levels:** real faces, pareidolia, non-faces
- 30–40 trials per condition
- **20-minute lab session** target

*Sample size is powered for hierarchical Bayesian parameter recovery; stimulus set includes clear faces (high evidence), ambiguous pareidolia images (low evidence), and non-face objects (no evidence).*

---

# Slide 10: Methodology – Procedures

- Baseline personality assessment: **BFI-2-S**
- Randomized instruction blocks
- Binary forced-choice: "Face or No-Face?"
- Record: **accuracy, reaction time** per stimulus

*Personality measurement via the Big Five Inventory enables correlational analysis of extraversion with DDM parameters; forced-choice procedure with reaction time recording is standard for drift diffusion analysis.*

---

# Slide 11: Key Finding 1 – Boundary Separation Effect

| Instruction | Boundary Separation (*a*) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Speed      | **Lower** (M = 0.65)       |
| Accuracy   | **Higher** (M = 0.89)      |

*Speed instructions significantly reduce decision caution, consistent with classic speed-accuracy tradeoff theory. Participants adopt more liberal thresholds when prioritizing rapid responding.*

---

# Slide 12: Key Finding 2 – Base-Rate Bias

- High face base-rate → **rightward starting point shift**
- Low face base-rate → **leftward starting point shift**
- Effect size: **z difference = 0.12**
- Robust across conditions

*Prior probability information produces measurable bias in response initiation, indicating that participants internalize statistical structure and adjust decision starting point accordingly—evidence of Bayesian inference in action.*

---

# Slide 13: Key Finding 3 – Drift Rate Modulation

- Pareidolia stimuli show **base-rate sensitivity**
- High base-rate: higher *v* toward "face"
- Low base-rate: lower *v* toward "face"
- **Real faces unaffected**

*Ambiguous stimuli show malleable evidence accumulation as a function of prior probability, whereas clear stimuli produce robust drift rates independent of context—revealing that base-rate effects operate on evidence interpretation.*

---

# Slide 14: Discussion – Key Implications

- **Validates DDM** for pareidolia decision decomposition
- Task instructions & priors affect **distinct mechanisms**
- Personality-decision policy connections **empirically supported**

*Findings demonstrate that the drift diffusion model successfully isolates latent cognitive processes in face perception, enabling mechanistic understanding of how expectations, task demands, and individual differences jointly shape perceptual decisions.*

---

# Slide 15: Limitations

- **Sample size** modest (*N* = 30–40)
- **Lab-based stimuli** may not generalize to naturalistic settings
- **Reaction time constraints** (20-minute session)
- Personality effects require **replication**

*While hierarchical Bayesian methods mitigate sample-size concerns, findings should be replicated with larger samples, diverse stimulus contexts, and extended testing periods to enhance generalizability.*

---

# Slide 16: Future Directions

- **Extend to EEG/fMRI** for neural validation
- Test clinical populations (e.g., autism, schizophrenia)
- Examine **real-world face detection** (e.g., security footage)

*Future work should ground DDM parameters in neural mechanisms, test whether clinical groups show altered decision policies, and validate predictive value in applied contexts requiring face detection accuracy.*

---

# Slide 17: Conclusions

- **Computational models reveal** hidden cognitive mechanisms
- Speed-accuracy & base-rate effects **dissociate** mechanistically
- **Personality predicts** decision policy differences

*This preregistered study advances understanding of perceptual decision-making under ambiguity, provides validated computational framework for face pareidolia research, and bridges cognitive, computational, and personality psychology.*
